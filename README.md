In collapsed structure search and rescue (CSSR) operations, the timely and accurate detection of trapped victims is critical to saving lives. Traditional search methods can be time-consuming and may miss individuals buried deep beneath the rubble. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced technology, specifically a millimeter-wave radar sensor, to enhance human detection in such scenarios.

The system is designed to detect human bodies buried up to 4 meters below the ground. At its core, the device is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which processes data from the millimeter-wave radar sensor. This sensor is highly sensitive and capable of penetrating debris and rubble, allowing rescue teams to locate victims more effectively. The real-time data collected by the sensor is displayed on an LCD screen, providing clear and immediate feedback to the rescue team. This interface is user-friendly, allowing rescuers to quickly interpret the results and act accordingly.

By incorporating this technology, the project aims to significantly reduce the time needed to locate victims and enhance the accuracy of detection, particularly in challenging environments where traditional methods may fall short. The system is portable and can be integrated into rescue teams' equipment, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of CSSR operations. Ultimately, this device has the potential to save lives by providing a more reliable and rapid means of human detection in disaster zones, drastically improving rescue outcomes in critical situations.
